## Flower_Image_Classifier
This AI image classifier can identify and classify between 102 flowers

# Why did I build this project? 
I built this project mainly because I know most of the people have problems with knowing or classifying flowers. I know there are nature experts here and about, but for those who find it difficult to classify flowers, I hope that my project will be a perfect nature guide for you. h

# What problem does it solve? 
As I already pointed out before, it solves the problems of those who find it hard or challenging to know or classify various types of flowers.

# What have I learnt while doing this project? 
I learnt mostly how to make a machine learning model, though I also learnt that you have to be very patient to make good code, especially AI image classifiers, with their training time being long.

# How did I collect the data/where did I get the data from?
I collected the data from TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview. 

# Talk about how good my machine learning model is: 
- accuracy: 0.8735 
- val_accuracy: 0.1688
